## About Me
I am a current student and Retired Army Veteran pursuing a degree in Network Management. My personal philosophy is _"Life is a Team Sport"_ in that it is impossible for an individual to achieve lasting success if they go about it alone. 

### My Interest
**Motorcycles:** During my free time I enjoy riding and working ono my Harley Davidson motorcycle. As a long-time enthusiast, I often enjoy a nice days ride with no particular destination in mind. Concerning style, I believe a well-dressed bike can never have too much chrome, can never be too loud, and can never have a big enough motor.   
**Computer Networking:** As a new student, I have a growing interest in computer networks, particularly in how they interact with other information technology disciplines.  As a result, I am spending more time outside of school requirements learning the industry.  
**History:** My interest in history began through a military requirement to study leaders from the past.  This later grew to include foreign cultures, religious history, and different world empires.

### Websites I recommend:
[Jeremy's IT Lab](https://www.jeremysitlab.com) is the primier site for people looking to learn about networking fundamentals, given from the perspective of an experienced Network Engineer. Also, his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremysITLab/featured) channel offers comprehensive free training material for those preparing for Cisco's CCNA certification, along with others.   

Another site I recommend is [AllSides Technologies Inc](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news). For me this is a trusted news source because it exposes it's readers to information and ideas from "all sides" of the political spectrum so the individual better understand the issues and draw their own conclusions. Their about us page states:  
> AllSides Technologies Inc. strengthens our democratic society with balanced news, [media bias ratings](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/ratings), diverse perspectives, and real conversation.
