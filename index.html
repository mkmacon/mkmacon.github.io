I chose the Harley-Davidson color palette because their iconic brand and color scheme is recognizable around the world. <em>Black</em> is a symbol of Power, Elegance, and Timeless Appeal while the <em>Orange</em> adds a touch of Vibrancy, Passion, and a Thrill of the Open Road. If colors could talk, I'm sure these would sound like a Big V-twin Milwaukee-Eight motor with true dual exhaust.
